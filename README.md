Discovery service using a pub/sub model designed in `kdb+`.

# Getting started


# Dashboard

Accessing localhost:8080 on a browser, will bring you to web dashboard. 

This dashboard uses websockets to communicate with a backend kdb+ discovery service. 

Connect to the kdb+ service using the details: `localhost:9090`.

> *Note: if you are not running this locally, change `localhost` to the IP of the server where the master discovery service is running.*
